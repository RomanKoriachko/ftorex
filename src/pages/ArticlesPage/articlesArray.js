            "Urea is one of the most popular types of fertilizer. Its adaptability gives it an edge over other fertilizers. Urea-46 has the ability to adapt to any type of soil. It is primarily used in agriculture as a fertilizer or animal feed. Urea ammonium nitrate contains a high quantity of nitrogen. It is often combined with both pesticides and insecticides to kill foreign elements in a soil. The fertilizer is chemically modified to prevent the loss of nitrogenous compounds in the atmosphere. So, the nitrogen content in the air remains the same even when the urea degrades in the soil. To maintain a constant air nitrogen content, experts also recommend converting the urea into formaldehyde which is converted into ammonia at a rate that complements the plant’s development. ",
